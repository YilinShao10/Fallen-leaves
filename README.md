# Fallen Leaves

 https://yilinshao10.github.io/Fallen-leaves/

This project includes two main interactive functionalities: 
1. Falling leaves will suspend their descent and remain in place when the mouse cursor hovers over them.
2. 2. Clicking the leaf at the very bottom of the screen causes it to shatter and trigger a related sound effect.
